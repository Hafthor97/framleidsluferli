                <p>I started assignment 2 and did all the drawings in Fusion.</p>
                <p>
                    The next day I used Fablab to export my drawing into a DXF file and 
                    fixed it in Inkscape and then I cut it with the laser cutter.

                <p>
                    I opened Fablab with my drawing from the day before and 
                    moved it over to Cura and set it up for 3D printing and then
                    printed it out.

                    My group started planning the final project, 
                    we started drawing what we wanted to do. We didn't do much but 
                    now we have some idea of what we want to do for the final project.

                    The group discussed today how we were going to split up the project. 
                    We made some progress but still a long way to go.

                    I started 3D scanning. I used the software Regard3D and decided 
                    to 3D scan a vodka bottle. It turned out to be way harder and more time 
                    consuming than I thought. In the end, after having messed around with 
                    many of the options I was satisfied with a result.

                    The group started work on the final project we decided to make a 
                    cutting board for the kitchen with resin inside. We used Inventor to 
                    draw it up. We decided to make the board rectangular and with a handle 
                    on the end off the cutting board. We made a hole on the handle so that 
                    we could hang it up on something like a hook. In the beginning we made 
                    the cutting board have a bottom part but in the end we decided to 
                    have it epoxy all the way through as shown in the description of the project. 
                    As we could not execute the project we would have chosen something like oak.

                    Today we made the MIT license for our project and we also made the bill of materials 
                    which did not take that much time.

                    The final project could not be produced due to Covid – 19 and therefore 
                    the workload for the course got cut drastically.
